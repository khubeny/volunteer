    <h2> Our Story </h2>
    <p>We’re Christina, Katherine, and Maanasa from the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program at the Adobe San Jose location! We spent five weeks learning programming languages and computer basics to prepare us to spend the last two weeks completing a final project. 
This program has been an amazing experience; a fact helped by our fellow friends in the class, our fantastic teacher and TAs and of course our love for coding! We are girls who code now and in the future.

        <p>Christina Chan</p>
        <p> She is an upcoming senior at Silver Creek High School who really likes her boba. Christina has been interested in STEM related activities for as long as she can remember. One can see this as she says things resembling “Math is fun!” and “I go to school just for calculus.” A bit about school would include her involvement in clubs and programs. As a Treasurer and Historian she tries her best to help others enjoy themselves and take their chances in making unforgettable memories. Her hobbies include crocheting, watching cartoons and anime, solving puzzles, reading ―especially comics― doodling, and coding of course! She wishes to pursue a future in computer science, engineering or animation and use her knowledge to help others in their journeys through life because life is a trip everyone should enjoy and help each other with. She also really likes animals. A LOT. And is apparently “a ball of sunshine”.
